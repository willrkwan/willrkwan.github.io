## Projects

### [Analyzing Kelowna's Walkability](/kelowna_walkability/)
Developed a comprehensive walkability index for Kelowna, BC using multi-criteria spatial analysis. Integrated six key metrics: destination density, road connectivity, intersection density, land use diversity, slope analysis, and aesthetic features—to assess neighborhood walkability across dissemination areas.

## Applied GIS: Real-World Spatial Problem Solving

Coursework from GIS 480 demonstrating practical applications of spatial analysis techniques across environmental planning, wildlife conservation, and cartographic production.

### Lab 2: Wildlife Corridors Foundation
Established baseline spatial datasets for wildlife movement analysis through data preparation and foundational corridor mapping techniques.
