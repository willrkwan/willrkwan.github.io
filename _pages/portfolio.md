## Projects

### [Analyzing Kelowna's Walkability](/kelowna_walkability/)
Developed a walkability index for the City of Kelowna in Python (pandas) and ArcGIS Pro using multi-criteria spatial analysis. Integrated literature-based metrics (proximity, density, diversity, connectedness, and attractiveness) to assess walkability across dissemination areas.

## Memos for GIS 480: Practical Applications in GIS

Lab work for GIS 480 involved exposure to common GIS workflows, working with incomplete and messy real-world datasets, and minimal guidance. Each lab required interpreting a problem statement, selecting appropriate methods, and communicating results through professional-quality maps and concise technical memos. These exercises reinforced methodological decision-making, data QA/QC, and clear communication of assumptions, limitations, and results.

### Wildlife Corridors Foundation
Established baseline spatial datasets for wildlife movement analysis through data preparation and foundational corridor mapping techniques.

### Habitat Suitability Analysis
Conducted Spatial Ecological Inventory (SEI) analysis using Regional District of Central Okanagan wildlife habitat ratings, quantifying habitat areas by classification type.

### Wildlife Corridor Connectivity
Identified critical wildlife movement corridors through landscape permeability analysis and statistical validation of connectivity zones.

### Coastal Inundation Modeling
Modeled flood scenarios at multiple elevation thresholds (35m and 350m) to assess potential inundation impacts and compare scenario outcomes.

### Classification Accuracy Assessment
Validated land cover classifications through error matrix analysis, calculating overall accuracy and producer's/user's accuracy statistics.  
[View Memo](/assets/documents/gis480/lab06.pdf)

### GIS Workflow Automation
Designed and documented automated geoprocessing models using ArcGIS Model Builder for walk-time service area analysis, complete with user documentation.  
[View Memo](/assets/documents/gis480/lab07.pdf)

### Cartographic Map Series Production
Created standardized multi-page map products using data-driven pages, demonstrating automated cartographic production workflows.
